    "Welcome to the IMDb Web Scraping Adventure Lab!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will embark on a mission to unearth valuable insights from the vast sea of data available on IMDb, one of the largest online databases of movie, TV, and celebrity information. As budding data scientists and business analysts, you have been tasked to scrape a specific subset of data from IMDb to assist film production companies in understanding the landscape of highly-rated movies in a defined time period. Your insights will potentially influence the making of the next netflix movie!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world where data has become the new currency, businesses are leveraging big data to make informed decisions that drive success and profitability. The entertainment industry, being no exception, utilizes data analytics to comprehend market trends, audience preferences, and the performance of films based on various parameters such as director, genre, stars involved, etc. IMDb stands as a goldmine of such data, offering intricate details of almost every movie ever made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a Python script using `BeautifulSoup` and `pandas` to scrape IMDb movie data based on user ratings and release dates. This script should be able to filter movies with ratings above a certain threshold and within a specified date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function named `scrape_imdb` that takes four parameters: `title_type`,`user_rating`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.\n",
    "- The function should return a DataFrame with the following columns:\n",
    "  - **Movie Nr**: The number representing the movie’s position in the list.\n",
    "  - **Title**: The title of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Year**: The year the movie was released.\n",
    "  - **Rating**: The IMDb rating of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Runtime (min)**: The duration of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "  - **Genre**: The genre of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Description**: A brief description of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Director**: The director of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Stars**: The main stars of the movie.\n",
    "  - **Votes**: The number of votes the movie received.\n",
    "  - **Gross ($M)**: The gross earnings of the movie in millions of USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will execute this script to scrape data for movies with the Title Type `Feature Film` that have a user rating of `7.5 and above` and were released between `January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1992`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to experiment with different title types, dates and ratings to ensure your code is versatile and can handle various searches effectively!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Beautiful Soup Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)\n",
    "- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)\n",

    "Your first mission is to familiarize yourself with the IMDb advanced search page. Head over to [IMDb advanced search](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/) and input the following parameters, keeping all other fields to their default values or blank:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Title Type**: Feature film\n",
    "- **Release date**: From 1990 to 1992 (Note: You don't need to specify the day and month)\n",
    "- **User Rating**: 7.5 to -\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon searching, you'll land on a page showcasing a list of movies, each displaying vital details such as the title, release year, and crew information. Your task is to scrape this treasure trove of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carefully examine the resulting URL and construct your own URL to include all the necessary parameters for filtering the movies."

    "You can choose another website that interests you and is good for scraping data. Websites like Wikipedia or The New York Times are good options. The main goal is still the same: get useful data and learn how to scrape it from a website that you find interesting. It's a chance to practice your web scraping skills and explore a source of information you like."

      "          , Abaddon is the last remaining Knight of Hell, a class of mighty demons who were among the first of their kind. Abaddon is too strong to be affected by exorcisms or to be killed by Ruby's knife. She is introduced in the eighth-season episode \"As Time Goes By\" in which she is sent to destroy the Men of Letters organization in 1958 and sets off in pursuit of Sam and Dean's grandfather, Henry Winchester, who escaped with the key to the Men of Letters' bunker. Wanting to break into the bunker to gain access to the powerful supernatural spells and artifacts inside, Abaddon follows Henry through time to the present and hunts him and his grandsons throughout the episode. As a result, she holds Sam hostage to force Dean to hand over Henry and the key, promising to let Sam and Dean go after the trade. Abaddon goes back on her agreement and ends up mortally wounding Henry, but not before he shoots her in the head with a bullet engraved with a devil's trap, binding her powers and her to her now-paralyzed host body. Sam and Dean then cut her up and bury her in cement to forever entomb her. In \"Clip Show\", Sam and Dean need a demon to cure for the third trial to close the gates of Hell, so they sew Abaddon back together to use her, without reattaching her hands or removing the bullet. Abaddon reveals that she had been sent to kill the priest who found a way to cure demons, and that while torturing him, she found out about the Men of Letters (including her host Josie Sands) from him. This ultimately resulted in her possessing Josie and attacking the Men of Letters. While Sam and Dean take a phone call from Crowley outside, Abaddon frees herself and escapes by controlling one of her severed hands and using it to remove the bullet from her skull. In the following episode, the season finale \"Sacrifice\", she arrives in response to Crowley's distress call but attacks him rather than help him. Abaddon declares her intention of taking over Hell, only to be driven away when Sam sets her ablaze in holy fire.\n",

She brings Crowley's human son Gavin forward in time and tortures him until Crowley agrees to help her set up a trap for Sam and Dean. In an attempt to destroy them all at once, Abaddon sends Crowley to the Winchesters to retrieve the First Blade and then lead them to her. Crowley manages to double-cross Abaddon and warn Dean of the trap, but he is unable to restrain her. Abaddon ends up shooting Crowley with a devil's trap bullet, preventing him from interfering in the upcoming fight. Before she can enact the rest of her plan and kill Crowley, Gavin, and the Winchesters, she is slain by Dean wielding the First Blade. Following Abaddon's death, most demons go back to following Crowley. Those that remained loyal to Abaddon tried to ambush Dean following their leader's death in \"Black\" only to be easily killed themselves.\n",

He explains that in Hell he tortures souls and loves his job and as such, he wants to restore Hell back to normal. While reluctant, the Winchesters and Castiel agree to ally with Belphegor who promises to leave Jack's body as soon as he finds a suitable new vessel. Belphegor helps the three escape the horde of zombies that has them trapped and offers a spell to contain the escaped souls to a one-mile radius around the cemetery where they were released. Working with Dean, Belphegor successfully casts the spell and contains the ghosts. However, he reveals to Dean that every door in Hell was opened which means two to three billion ghosts are now loose and in addition, Lucifer's Cage was opened, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc. In \"Raising Hell\", Belphegor continues to aid the Winchesters, Castiel and Rowena in their efforts to contain the escaped ghosts and the failing barrier.

While Belphegor and Castiel travel into Hell to get the crook, Sam and Rowena will perform a spell to seal the rupture. Though Belphegor claims he only needs Castiel as backup, Castiel remains suspicious of his motives, especially upon discovering that the crook is in a chest sealed in Enochian which only Castiel can read. The two are attacked by Ardat who reveals that Belphegor's true motive has always been to take power in Hell for himself and is using the Winchesters and Castiel for that purpose. Belphegor kills Ardat and confirms that she was telling the truth, intending to use the crook to draw all of the demons and souls inside of himself to gain unlimited power. As Belphegor uses the horn, he is beaten to the ground by Castiel and tries to pretend to be Jack to get Castiel to stop. Seeing through the deception, Castiel smites Belphegor without hesitation, killing the demon and destroying the crook but at the cost of burning Jack's body into a charred skeleton. After learning of Belphegor's demise, Dean is angry with Castiel as he feels that the demon was a threat they could have dealt with at a later time and Belphegor's demise before they could finish the plan resulted in Rowena having to sacrifice herself to send the remaining souls back to Hell. Castiel's actions with Belphegor as well as his hiding Jack's soulless state create a rift between the two for some time.\n",

Following Gerald's death, Crowley becomes more accepting of Rowena while it is revealed that Rowena and Trish lied and used Gerald as a scapegoat to gain Crowley's trust.

Despite his evil nature, Ramiel is indicated to have not committed any acts of evil during his tenure on Earth in retirement, at least nothing traceable. While discussing Ramiel during the planning meeting, it is noted that the only thing he's done for sure is night fishing. In contrast, Dagon and Asmodeus are known to still have committed evil acts while retired. During his confrontation with the Winchesters, Ramiel predicts Dagon's approaching role in events when he tells them that \"my sister Dagon has taken an interest\" in Lucifer's child. As well, before meeting Ramiel, the Winchesters were unaware that there was more than one Yellow-Eyed Demon as the only Prince they had previously met was Azazel.

      "          It is unknown when and how Samhain was actually born, driven to hell, died, the reason why he went to hell at all, and was created. The fact that his resurrection breaks one of the 66 seals, however, suggests that it was created before the imprisonment of Lucifer. Before he was imprisoned in Hell centuries ago, he reigned over Earth on Halloween night. People kept their children inside, they left treats to appease him and they left carved pumpkins on their doorsteps to worship him. His power seems to be intermediate between that of black-eyed demons and white-eyed demons. He maintains all traits and powers of a normal black-eyed demon, and he also proved capable of emanating a demonic energy blast similar to Lilith's. Unlike other demons, however, he is capable of summoning monsters, such as ghosts, zombies, etc. He is summoned by two witches, one of whom he kills himself, but Sam manages to exorcise him again with his powers. He differs from other demons in that its eye color is either pale blue and/or possibly gray. His eyes appear to be a hybridized iris pigment of blue and gray, but his sclera is white and his pupil black. Samhain is the only so far known Whitish Eyed Demon and presumably the only one ever.\n",

This draws the attention of the Winchesters and the angels as the raising of Samhain is one of the 66 Seals. Sam and Dean kill Don, but Tracy reveals herself and successfully summons Samhain, breaking the seal. Samhain possesses Don's body and recognizes Tracy before killing her. Samhain is unable to tell that Sam and Dean are alive due to a \"mask\" of blood they smeared on their faces so he leaves them alone.\n",

Sam and Dean rescue most of the kids and Dean deals with the monsters while Sam faces Samhain. Sam proves immune to Samhain's power so they fight hand to hand, but even with the demon-killing knife, Sam is no match for the demon. Finally, in the end, Sam manages to exorcise Samhain with his powers and sends him back to Hell.\n",

Later, Asmodeus sends Sierra and Harrington to kill the Winchesters and Prophet Donatello Redfield while he uses the Nephilim Jack to release the Shedim from Hell. Sierra attacks Dean when Dean is alone in his motel room, easily breaking free of Dean's attempts to pin him and throwing Dean onto the bed.

Most appear to have had some kind of negative encounter with the supernatural, which prompts them to become hunters. While hunters, by their nature, operate 'off-the-grid, there are, nevertheless, hunter communities that meet and interact with each other to exchange information and stories; the Harvelle Roadhouse was one such location until it was burnt down. Typically, hunters find cases by consulting newspapers to track down information about suspicious deaths in certain areas. Some cases come about thanks to contact with people they knew before becoming hunters or contact with people they helped during previous hunts who turn to them for their expertise. Some hunters are shown to have particular targets, such as Sam and Dean's initial hunts in the show's first two seasons focusing on tracking the Yellow Eyed Demon who killed Dean and Sam's parents, or Gordon Walker 'specializing' in hunting vampires.\n",

Asa was saved by hunter Mary Winchester who had come out of retirement briefly to tie up some loose ends, including killing the werewolf and stopping its killing spree. Asa became interested in what Mary was doing, especially when she told him that she intended to return to retirement. Inspired by the encounter, Asa went on to become a hunter himself despite his mother's objections and became legendary in the hunting community. Asa wrote postcards throughout his life to Mary detailing his discoveries and hunts, but never sent them as he never learned her whereabouts. During his hunting trips, Asa had many trysts  with local women, one of which, with witch Tasha Banes, resulted in two children, Max and Alicia. In 2016, Asa met Sheriff\n",

After escaping from Hell again, Jael began a personal vendetta against Asa, murdering a woman that Asa was seeing as well as other people he cared about and leaving their bodies in the forest for him to find. In 2016, Asa hunted Jael through a forest with his best friend Bucky Sims despite Asa not being armed with his angel blade, leading to an argument between the two men.

While never meeting personally, Sam and Dean recalled hearing stories about him in Ellen's roadhouse, and Asa's peer hunters were quick to share stories of him killing five wendigos in one night. Dean expressed skepticism initially (due to hearing the story in the midst of a drinking game inspired by the exploit) but he later confided to Sam that he believed Asa to be a 'legit' hunter, evidenced by his armory, complete with an angel blade. During the funeral, they encountered their mother Mary who had recently been resurrected following her death in 1983. Mary had received word of Asa's death and was distressed to learn that he had become a hunter. Jael took advantage of the funeral to target the other hunters one by one, finally possessing Jody. In Jody's body, Jael confessed to feeling cheated out of Asa's murder and forced Bucky to admit that he had killed Asa. Before carrying out a brutal revenge against the hunters, Sam, Dean, Max, Alicia and Mary, exorcised Jael from Jody in a sequential attack, with each subsequent hunter picking up the Latin incantation where the previous one left off. As a result of Jael's efforts, Bucky was disgraced for killing his best friend. Rather than exacting revenge upon Bucky themselves, the hunters chose to spread the true story of what happened. The next morning, Asa was given a Hunter's Funeral alongside the two hunters murdered by Jael at his wake.\n",

Although she doesn't believe it at first, she realizes the truth when she witnesses a leviathan eat her supervisor and shapeshift to replace him—something Dick explains they cannot do to Charlie, as she possesses a rare \"spark\" that can't be perfectly replicated. Sam and Dean recruit a terrified Charlie to retrieve Frank's hard drive to protect the information there, as well as to break into Dick's office and hack his emails to gain information for their side. She does so, which alerts Sam and Dean to a secret package meant for Dick which they then steal; the package is later revealed to hold the secret to defeating the leviathan.

When two of her \"subjects\" are killed, it draws Sam and Dean's attention and they head to Moondoor. Charlie's initial reaction is to flee and start a new life again, fearing that she will once more become a target for monsters. After learning why Sam and Dean are there, she agrees to help them investigate the deaths and other mysterious injuries that have happened. Charlie is eventually captured by a good fairy named Gilda who has kidnapped her on her master's orders. Charlie is instantly smitten with Gilda. Dean, Sam and Gerry eventually find Charlie with help from the \"prisoner\", only to find that she is making out with Gilda. It is revealed that Gerry is Gilda's master; he has unrequited feelings for Charlie and has bought a spellbook with which to control Gilda and force her to kill other players as part of a scheme to make Charlie fall in love with him. Charlie eventually destroys the book to set Gilda free and render Gerry powerless. Afterward, she and Gilda share a goodbye kiss before Gilda returns to her world with Gerry to have Gerry punished. Charlie decides to stop running and changing her identity and to stay and make a life for once. She tells Sam and Dean to call her if they ever need her help again. The three of them participate in a mock battle between their group and the other LARPers, which Charlie's side wins. Charlie's backstory is explored when she returns in \"Pac-Man Fever\" to give Sam and Dean a case. After she proves to be an excellent shot, Dean takes her as his (temporary) partner instead of Sam, who has become increasingly ill from the trials. Charlie is eventually captured by the creature they are hunting, a type of djinn, who poisons Charlie and places her in a nightmare from which she won't wake up from. In her nightmare, she is trapped in a video game she stole as a kid, recreated, and gave out for free, and where she must endlessly protect her hospitalized mother from super-soldier vampires. It is revealed that her parents had been involved in a car accident when driving over to pick Charlie up from a sleepover, resulting in her father dying and her mother rendered brain-dead. Charlie has been paying for the care of her mother, whom she refuses to let go due to her feelings of guilt over the accident. When Dean takes a potion to enter her nightmare himself to save her, he convinces Charlie that she must let her mother go to move on.

Sam suggests that Michael was spying on them through his connection to Garth and they hope that killing Michael will free Garth from his control. Garth remains locked in the trunk throughout \"Nihilism\" with subsequent events preventing the original plan to retrieve Garth until after Michael is defeated and locked away in Dean's mind.\n",

At first, Dean bonds with Gordon, but Gordon proves himself to be bloodthirsty and sadistic as he tortures one of the captured vampires, even though he knows these particular vampires feed off cattle blood and do not kill humans. After Gordon tries to force one of the vampires to drink Sam's blood while torturing her with dead man's blood, Dean, seeing the vampire resist the urge, ends up beating Gordon in a fight and leaves Gordon tied to a chair while the vampires escape. Later, while performing an exorcism, Gordon learns about the coming demonic war, Azazel's special children, and Sam's powers. In \"Hunted\", he kills Scott Carey- another of the 'special children'- and then tracks Sam down and tries to kill him, convinced that Sam and those like him are 'traitors' to humanity. However, Dean intervenes, and, after a scuffle, Gordon knocks Dean out, ties him up, and uses him as bait to catch Sam in a booby trap of grenades set with trip wires. Sam manages to evade the trap and knocks Gordon out. As the brothers leave the damaged house, Gordon regains consciousness and chases them, firing two pistols in their direction.

As the demon slaughters everyone else, Henry is given a mysterious box by surviving Men of Letters Elder Larry Ganem and ordered to protect it from Abaddon. Escaping through time, Henry ends up coming out of his grandsons' motel room closet in the year 2013, having overshot his attempt to get help from John closer to his own time. Henry's arrival and search for John creates much confusion for the Winchesters who only knew of him as their grandfather who had supposedly run out on John when he was four. Henry reveals to Sam and Dean their family's history with the Men of Letters, a family legacy going back centuries that the Winchesters had been unaware of as Henry hadn't been around to pass it on to John and the order had been wiped out by Abaddon. However, Henry expresses disgust that his grandsons are hunters due to having a low view of hunters in general. Learning of his son's fate, Henry attempts to travel back in time and change things, but he is stopped by Dean. At the same time, Sam learns from Larry Ganem that the box contains a key that opens a veritable supernatural treasure trove that must never fall into Abaddon's hands. After the demon captures Sam, Dean agrees to trade Henry and the box for Sam, but the two men conspire together to defeat the demon. Henry is able to trap Abaddon in Josie's body with a devil's trap bullet to the head, but he is mortally wounded in the process. Unable to kill the powerful demon, Dean takes advantage of Henry trapping her to cut the demon up and bury the pieces to forever entomb her. Henry dies in his grandsons' arms, content with his own sacrifice, apologizing for his earlier disgust of them being hunters and proclaiming that as long as the Winchesters are still around, there's still hope. He also expresses his pride in John, confident that he was a good man based on what he saw in Sam and Dean. Sam and Dean bury Henry near his friends from the Men of Letters and decide to embrace the family legacy that Henry had introduced to them.\n",

In reality, Abaddon plots to infiltrate and then destroy the Men of Letters. Unaware of the truth, Henry departs with Abaddon, his faith in his purpose renewed. In the present, Sam learns of these events from a nun who had witnessed what had happened and connects it to his grandfather.

Learning that they believe May to have been a Nephilim, Lily tells them the truth about what happened. Sam and Dean believe her and Dean goes off to find Castiel while Lily stays with Sam and convinces him of the threat Ishim poses to Dean. Lily and Sam arrive as Ishim prepares to kill Dean and Lily engages Ishim in battle. Even aided by the Winchesters Lily proves to be no match for Ishim who fights through her telekinesis and prepares to kill her with his angel blade. To Lily's shock, she's saved by Castiel who kills Ishim from behind with his angel blade. Though Lily gets her revenge with Ishim's death, she is left unsure of whether or not she can let go of her vengeance against Castiel due to revenge being all she's had for over a century. Castiel apologizes to Lily and promises that if she finds she can't forgive him and wants to come after him for revenge again one day, he will be waiting for her. In tears, Lily thanks Castiel and departs, presumably off to start a new life.\n",

Arthur sees Dean as the same as him and the two decide to take down a vampire nest together. At the nest, Arthur initially arms himself with a gun, but decides to use a machete instead like Dean. The two men find only one vampire hiding in the nest and Arthur beats upon her before Dean stops him to try things his way. When Dean promises to grant the vampire a quick end, she tells them that her nest is going after the British Men of Letters.\n",

In \"War of the Worlds\", he is going by the alias of Alexander Ketch, pretending to be Arthur's twin brother. However, Dean sees through the disguise and Arthur explains that he had made a deal with Rowena for a resurrection spell that he needs recharged which brought him back after Mary killed him. Arthur saves the Winchesters from a group of demons and insists that he is on their side and that his previous actions only came from being a soldier on the opposite side of a war from them.

Arthur once again encounters the Winchesters who have Castiel knock him unconscious and lock him in the Impala's trunk, intending to kill him and scatter his ashes to make his death permanent. Arthur once more escapes confinement, just in time to use a demon bomb to drive Lucifer and Anael away, saving the Winchesters and Castiel. Stating that Lucifer being loose upon the Earth is a line too far for him, Arthur reveals his alliance with Asmodeus and offers to work with the Winchesters as a double agent to stop Lucifer, Asmodeus and the threat of an alternate reality Michael. Recognizing that they need him, the Winchesters reluctantly agree to the alliance. Upon Arthur's return to Asmodeus' lair, Asmodeus reveals that he has acquired the Archangel Blade, the one weapon that can kill an archangel such as Lucifer or Michael. After Arthur points out that the blade can only be used to kill an archangel by another archangel, Asmodeus introduces him to the captive archangel Gabriel who has been believed dead for nearly eight years.\n",

Asmodeus states that Arthur is more wicked than any demon he knows \"and I know 'em all\", but recognizes that Arthur seeks redemption for his past actions which he doesn't think that Arthur can get. Once Asmodeus leaves him alone, Arthur gets back at him by rescuing Gabriel and steals Asmodeus' store of Gabriel's extracted grace as well as the Archangel Blade. Arthur brings all three to the Winchesters, seeking sanctuary from Asmodeus in return which Dean agrees to. After the Winchesters open a rift to Apocalypse World, Arthur decides to join Dean on the mission, feeling that he is safer in another universe when Asmodeus will inevitably come looking for him.\n",

Against Arthur's wishes, Dean sets out to rescue Charlie, the two men being forced to work together to survive. Along the way, Dean tells Arthur of his inability to save Charlie and Arthur admits his own regrets that he never even tried to save the lives of those he cares about. Together, Dean and Arthur raid a POW camp, killing several angels and liberating Charlie and several other human prisoners. With the rift closing, Arthur chooses to remain behind in Apocalypse World with Charlie to continue the mission to find Mary and Jack and to help coordinate for Dean's inevitable return with reinforcements.

However, Arthur has had no luck in his search.

Dean meets Ben and is struck by his familiar rock-music loving, girl ogling ways, but Lisa assures Dean that he is not Ben's father. Later Dean helps Ben out in an encounter with some bullies. Although his advice, to \"kick the kid in the nuts\", does not get Lisa's approval, Ben hugs Dean in thanks. Later Ben is one of the children taken by a mother Changeling, and one of her offspring imitates Ben and starts feeding on Lisa. Dean and Sam rescue all the children and kill the head Changeling, destroying the imitation Ben. Dean is impressed by Ben's cool headed behavior during the rescue, having put Ben in charge of helping the other children out a window.\n",

Eventually, Lisa lets him go in \"Two and a Half Men\". Dean talks to Ben on the phone in \"The Third Man\". After believing he is about to die after having been turned into a vampire in \"Live Free or Twi-Hard\", Dean returns to say goodbye. However, he struggles to control his vampiric urges and shoves Ben and flees. Ben tricks Dean into returning once more in \"Mannequin 3: The Reckoning\"; however, he fails to reconcile with Lisa and Dean explains to Ben that he fears that if he stayed around, Ben would end up like him. Ben is still upset and accuses Dean of abandoning his family. Ben and Lisa are kidnapped by the demon Crowley, in \"Let It Bleed\", in an attempt to force Dean to stand down. After they are rescued, Dean asks Castiel to wipe Ben and his mother's memories of him, which he does.\n",

With that half of the tablet, Kevin has learned the third trial: cure a demon. Kevin is left confused as to who Metatron is when Metatron reveals knowledge of the third trial as well. After Sam and Dean pretend to make a deal with Crowley to stop him killing people they have saved, Kevin digs up the first half of the demon tablet and reunites the two halves, giving the tablet to Sam and Dean who send him to the Men of Letters bunker for safety. When Dean and Castiel need to know the third trial to close the gates of Heaven, they take the angel tablet to Kevin who is distraught as he believed that it would be over once he was done with the demon tablet, causing an angry Castiel to yell at him that he is a Prophet until he dies. After completing the second trial, Dean calls Kevin who tells him that while he has found trials on the angel tablet, he does not see anything that matches what they have done. When Naomi shows up to tell Dean and Castiel that Metatron is really trying to expel all angels from Heaven, Kevin listens, but is unable to confirm what she has said. He later tries to leave the bunker, but stops when alarms start going off, signaling the fall of all angels to Earth.\n",

      "          After the angels fall, Kevin is left trapped in the bunker as it locks down and he panics, nearly shooting Dean with a crossbow when he arrives. Kevin is not happy to see that the Winchesters have Crowley captive and have not killed him. Kevin is put to work trying to find a way to reverse Metatron's spell using the angel tablet. When Dean calls Kevin to get him to confirm their cover at a military base, Kevin succeeds by hacking into the person he is talking to's computer and blackmailing them. He later gets a call from Abaddon and passes on her message to Sam and Dean and at their request, looks through the archives for a way to kill a Knight of Hell. Crowley, who is in a dungeon in the next room, taunts Kevin, causing Kevin to beat him with a sledgehammer. Crowley then claims that he never killed Kevin's mother and will lead Kevin to her if he releases him and that the Winchesters are just using him. While Kevin does not release Crowley, he decides to leave and look for his mother but is stopped by Dean who convinces him that his mother is as good as dead even if she is still alive. Dean tells him that the Winchesters consider both him and Castiel to be family and would die to protect him if need be. Kevin aids Sam and Dean with finding a spell to communicate with animals and is later asked by Dean to find a way to suppress an angel. Kevin finds a way, but is murdered by Gadreel possessing Sam soon afterwards on Metatron's orders. Dean burns his body in a Hunter's Funeral afterwards and is devastated by and blames himself for Kevin's death. A month after his death, Kevin returns as a ghost, having been stuck in the veil between worlds due to Heaven being closed. Kevin asks Sam and Dean to rescue his mother who he has learned from another ghost named Candy is still alive. With Candy's help, Sam and Dean track down Linda who tearfully reunites with Kevin. Despite the risks, Linda decides to take the ring Kevin is attached to and look after him until he can enter Heaven. Kevin similarly wants to look after his mother now that he has her back. Kevin informs Sam that he does not blame him for his death, aware that it was really Gadreel and asks Sam and Dean to put aside their differences and start being brothers again before leaving.\n",

He meets Lucifer and the latter informs him of his counterpart's status, which shocks him. Having a more black-and-white view of the world, Kevin sees Lucifer as evil due to his status as the Devil and apparently can't tell that Michael is just using him and doesn't care either way as Michael promises him a better life once he gets to the Winchesters world. Kevin finds a spell on the Angel Tablet that will open a rift to the Winchesters' universe, but it requires the grace of an archangel so Michael drains some of Lucifer's. Kevin's spell succeeds in opening a rift, but Lucifer uses the opportunity to escape through the rift which closes behind him.

Kevin claims to have perfected the spell from the Angel Tablet for Michael who intends to use it to open a rift and lead and invasion of the Winchesters' universe. As Jack prepares to go after Michael, Kevin reveals that he has been left behind as a trap to break Jack by showing him that he can't protect everyone. Having been promised by Michael that he will be reunited with his mother in Heaven, a desperate Kevin refuses to be talked down and activates a sigil burned into his chest that effectively turns Kevin into a suicide bomb. The blast kills Kevin and three resistance fighters, though Jack survives unharmed and shields Mary from the blast's effects. As Michael hoped, the suicide bombing devastates Jack from his inability to protect the people he cares about. Its later shown that Kevin also lied about perfecting the spell for Michael and that the lie was a part of the trap as Michael had no way to open a rift until Lucifer provided him with the spell from the Demon Tablet in \"Exodus.\"\n",

Magnus was a powerful magician who was so good at spells, he was made the Men of Letters Master of Spells right after he was initiated into the order. He acted as Henry Winchester, Sam and Dean's grandfather's mentor and designed most of the warding for the Men of Letters bunker. However, he felt that the Men of Letters should be more proactive, using their knowledge to fight evil instead of hiding it away and protecting it. Magnus' ideas got so radical that after he created the Werther Box, a vault designed to protect an important decryption codex but with a deadly alarm system, he was kicked out of the Men of Letters on May 16, 1956. As a result, he survived the massacre of the order by Abaddon in 1958. Crowley became aware of his separation from the Men of Letters and attempted to locate him to get into the Men of Letters bunker, but failed to find him. At some point Magnus changed his name from Cuthbert Sinclair to Magnus, the name the Men of Letters use while going incognito, long enough that he hadn't gone by it in a long time by 2014 and built himself a warded impenetrable hideout where he collected important supernatural artifacts and a zoo of various creatures including vampires and shapeshifters. Due to his proficiency with spells, Magnus made himself immortal, looking forever to be in his 30s despite being much older. Several weeks before the events of \"Blade Runners\", Magnus tracked down the mythical First Blade and acquired it for his collection. Searching for the First Blade to kill Abaddon, Sam and Dean tracked down Magnus with the help of the Men of Letters files and Crowley and got him to talk to them by mentioning their grandfather and the Men of Letters.

Following the destruction of the Men of Letters, Magnus' creation had caused at least four deaths and Sam and Dean set out to disarm it and get the codex. They eventually discovered that Magnus had designed the box so that only all of the blood of a Man of Letters could disarm the spell and open it, but by combining their blood, the Winchesters were able to safely open it.

When Crowley starts a hunt for Alphas to locate Purgatory, he starts sending telepathic messages to his \"children\" to create as many new vampires as they can. Dean sees this message when he's briefly infected with vampirism and the Campbells use it to track him down and capture him. The Alpha is tortured, but eventually breaks free, killing Christian Campbell. After a fight, Christian, who is revealed to be possessed by a demon, gets up and injects him with dead man's blood, incapacitating him. Afterwards, Crowley arrives and takes him away. The Alpha is held with all the other captured monsters in Crowley's prison, but escapes before Castiel can kill him like he does the other Alphas and monsters in the prison. The Alpha makes a deal with the Leviathans to share humanity among both species with the Leviathan substance that makes humans more docile making it easier for vampires to feed. After several of his vampires die after feeding on infected humans, the Alpha flees to his retreat at an old monastery where Sam and Dean track him down. However, Emily, a young woman he'd held prisoner for twelve years, calls him to warn him that they're coming. The Alpha captures Sam and Dean who ask for his blood, explaining that the Leviathan substance was what killed his vampires and that he'd been betrayed. The Alpha refuses to listen and after hearing that Edgar has arrived, orders the hunters locked up. The Alpha confronts Edgar who confirms Sam and Dean's story, telling him that the Leviathans intend to use the fact that so many monsters feed on humans to wipe them out. When Edgar insults Eve, the Alpha attacks him, throwing Borax in his face, but Edgar overpowers him. Before Edgar can kill the Alpha, Sam and Dean, who broke free, attack and Sam decapitates Edgar. Grateful for their actions and understanding that they have a common enemy, the Alpha gives Sam and Dean his blood without a fight and allows them to take a young boy named Alan he has captured. As they leave, warning him not to keep Edgar's head too close to his body, the Alpha taunts them that they truly want to kill him instead of leaving it for another time and promises to \"see you next season.\"\n",

These events were an attempt to break Bobby, one of the few remaining influences keeping Sam from agreeing to be Lucifer's vessel. In \"The Devil You Know\", Bobby temporarily sells his soul to Crowley to locate Death. In \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" — Death's first corporeal appearance — Death arrives in Chicago to precipitate a storm which would kill three million. His vehicle is a pale white 1959 Cadillac. In a lengthy conversation with Dean, he reveals that this and other actions is the influence of Lucifer's binding spell, which Death wishes to break. He presents Dean with his ring, the final piece allowing the Winchesters to open Lucifer's cage and re-imprison Lucifer. \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" also introduces Death's taste for the typical, renowned, and often unhealthy local restaurant foods of the places he visits, which becomes something of a running gag.\n",

      "          , Eleanor Visyak is a creature from Purgatory who is over 900 years old. She was released from there on March 10, 1937, by a spell performed by H.P. Lovecraft. She possessed the body of his maid, Eleanor. She has been living as a professor of medieval studies at San Francisco University. She has a romantic past with Bobby Singer. In \"Like a Virgin\", at Bobby's suggestion, Dean visits Dr. Visyak to gain information about dragons and how to kill them. She has a dragon killing sword - the Sword of Brunswick (or Braunschweig) - in her basement, which is stuck in a large rock. Dean extracts it using plastic explosives, breaking the sword in the process. While visiting Westborough, the son of Eleanor, who saw his mother possessed by a creature from Purgatory in 1937, Bobby sees a photo of the woman and realizes that it is the woman he knows as Eleanor Visyak. He finds her in a cabin - one of her 'safe houses' - and tells her he knows who she really is. She confirms his suspicions, but denies that she killed H.P. Lovecraft. Bobby warns her that Castiel is looking for her. He asks for the information about how to open a door to Purgatory, but she refuses to tell him, and also rejects his offer of protection. As she leaves the cabin at the end of the episode, Castiel appears and takes her. A flashback of Sam's in the finale \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" reveals that he, Bobby, and Dean found her, fatally wounded, in an alley. She recounts her tortured at the hands of Crowley and Castiel, and admits that she eventually gave in and revealed the spell to access to Purgatory, which involves the blood of a virgin and the blood of a creature from Purgatory. Eleanor dies before she can reveal where Crowley and Castiel are.\n",

She plants it inside a trucker, who goes on to kill his family. It then passes to one of his co-workers who kills 12 people. While investigating the murders, it infects Dean who kills his cousin Gwen, and then infects Samuel, and finally Bobby who kills Rufus while possessed. While possessing Bobby, it tells Dean and Sam that it was created by Eve, who intends for supernatural beings to take over the world. After acquiring the ashes of a Phoenix, said to be lethal to Eve, Sam, Dean, Bobby and Castiel take the fight to her in \"Mommy Dearest\". Eve reveals that her actions are purely a response to Crowley, still alive, and his capture and torture of her children. She speculates that he is after the souls in Purgatory, and claims that she was satisfied with the natural order of humans and monsters coexisting (with occasional bloodshed on both sides) until Crowley forced her hand. Eve dies after biting Dean, who had Phoenix ash in his blood, to which Crowley takes her body for autopsy. In \"There Will Be Blood!\", when the Leviathan Edgar is very dismissive towards the Alpha Vampire, he calls himself a \"son of Eve\", but Edgar calls the Alpha a \"mutt\" and Eve was \"barely worth being called one of us.\" When Edgar calls Eve a whore, the Alpha Vampire is enraged and attacks him. Though Eve does not appear herself, when Dean and Castiel return to Purgatory to seek out a 'Leviathan Blossom' for a spell to be used against God, Eve sends some Leviathans after them to capture Castiel, still angered at his role in taking the souls of Purgatory. However, Cas escapes with one of the Blossoms before he can be brought to her.\n",

To kill Hydeker, the Winchesters convinced Asher's older brother Michael to help, knowing that Hydeker would target him next.

Unlike common lore, they do not actually grant wishes, and instead put their victims into a dream-state where they play out a fantasy in their mind where their wish has come true while the djinn feeds off of them. Other djinn have shown the ability to instead place their victims in a sort of waking nightmare state where they hallucinate their worst fears before being killed. A bastard offshoot exists as well, feeding on fear instead of desire and instead of putting people into states where they imagine their greatest desire, they are put into a nightmare where they experience their worst fear. Both kinds of djinn, the regular djinn and the bastard offshoot can be killed by a silver knife dipped in lamb's blood. Regular djinn poison can be cured using an antidote developed by the Campbell family, but the antidote does not work on the bastard offshoot's poison. This is speculated to be because they are a different kind of djinn and need a different kind of antidote. Another way of saving a person under the influence of djinn poison is to wake them from their dream state which breaks the loop they are in and ends the effects of the poison.\n",

He is also haunted by visions of a young woman he found hanging in the djinn's lair. Dean decides to track down the djinn and reverse his wish, accompanied by a reluctant Sam. Upon arriving at the djinn's lair, Dean comes to the realization that he is not in an alternate reality after all but instead is in dream state while the djinn feeds on him.

According to Crowley, they will now be regular monsters, albeit ones that are much harder to kill. The remaining Leviathans heavily involved in the plan for humanity are slaughtered by Crowley and his army in the confusion, but Crowley indicates that there are more.

They force the Leviathan to take them to the Blossoms, who reveals that they grow in the ground after a Leviathan dies and their corpse decomposes after months. When brought to the Blossoms, it is revealed to be a trap and that the Leviathan's are working with Eve to capture Castiel for his role in killing Eve's Alphas and stealing the souls of Purgatory.

Dick has Edgar kidnap Kevin at the end of \"Reading is Fundamental\" and threatens Linda to get Kevin to translate the Word of God tablet in \"There Will Be Blood\". Dick correctly predicts that the Winchester brothers are planning to get the blood of the Alpha Vampire and of Crowley for the leviathan-killing bone described by the tablet; after sending Edgar on an ill-fated mission to kill the Alpha Vampire before the Winchesters can attain the alpha's blood, Dick summons and traps Crowley. Rather than kill the demon, however, Dick makes a deal with Crowley: in exchange for Crowley giving the Winchesters the wrong blood as part of a trap, the demons will get a free rein with humans in the world, excluding America, which is the place where the leviathans are currently targeting for its abundant food source. Foreseeing Crowley's betrayal, Dick also arranges for several decoys of himself positioned in Sucrocorp to fool the Winchesters into wasting the bone on a fake. However, Dean and Castiel ultimately find and confront Dick, whom Castiel is able to identify due to the brief time that the leviathans used him as their host. When the bone seemingly fails to work, Dick initially believes that he has won, only to find out that he himself has been tricked when Dean kills him with the real bone, sending him back to Purgatory. As an unintended consequence of using the bone, however, Dean and Castiel are pulled into Purgatory with him.\n",

It was developed by the Campbell family of hunters at some point in the past and is referred to as \"an old family recipe\" by Samuel Campbell. After learning of the cure when its used on Dean, the Winchesters put it to use occasionally to save recently turned vampires who have not yet fed. While other hunters are generally unaware of the cure's existence or how to make it, the Winchesters have shared it with a few others while using it during hunts. However, use of the cure is rare as the requirements, specifically the need for the vampire not to have fed yet on even a single drop of blood, make it rare that a situation is encountered where using the cure is an option.\n",

As a result, a pureblood werewolf named Justin, driven insane by loneliness after his peaceful pack was killed, turns a girl named Hayden Foster to be his mate, murdering her brother at the same time. The action draws the attention of British Men of Letters operative Mick Davies who calls in the Winchesters for help. After discovering that Hayden is a werewolf, Mick reluctantly kills her with a silver injection. In response, Justin turns young hunter Claire Novak to replace Hayden. Due to her emotional issues, Claire requests to be killed as she doesn't believe she can control herself, but the Winchesters instead decide to try an experimental cure created by the British Men of Letters to save her, a cure that has never worked on a human subject. As the Winchesters try to find Claire's sire, Justin attacks and abducts Claire, but the Winchesters and Mick follow him using a tracker implanted on Claire by Mick. During the scuffle that follows, Mick manages to draw Justin's live blood before killing him with a silver bullet, allowing the Winchesters to create the cure.

Martin is able to determine that they are dealing with a wraith whom the Winchesters unknowingly fall victim to, beginning to hallucinate due to the wraith's poison. Owing to their hallucinations, Sam assaults a doctor he believes to be the wraith with a silver-plated letter opener and nearly kills the man before Martin stops him after noticing the man's lack of reaction to being cut by the letter opener. Dean eventually discovers that the true wraith is the nurse who admitted them to the mental hospital, having taken the chance to infect them at the time. After Dean and Martin stop her from killing her next victim, the wraith goes after a restrained Sam and explains that psychiatric patients are more delectable to her. As the wraith prepares to kill Sam, Dean bursts in and manages to kill the wraith with a silver-plated letter opener to the heart. The wraith's death ends her effect on the Winchesters who quickly make their escape.\n",

However, a devil's trap constructed of iron rails at the corners of which churches were stationed successfully trapped him. Azazel was killed by the colt in \"All Hell Breaks Loose\". Until season 12, Azazel was the only known demon with Yellow Eyes. Ramiel was unaffected by a demon-killing knife, an angel blade, devil's-trap bullets since he was naturally immune to devil's traps. Ramiel was killed by The Lance of Michael. Dagon had the power to kill and destroy angels.

Through the grace of the archangel Gabriel, Asmodeus became the strongest of the yellow-eyed demons. However, the archangel Gabriel was able to effortlessly destroy him.

The black-eyed demons are often portrayed as mindless drones. Their powers and abilities include flying via smoke form, superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, invulnerability, immortality, telekinesis, and possession. Their weaknesses are exorcism, holy water, iron, rock salt, devil's traps, hallowed ground, holy fire, palo santos, Ruby's knife, the first blade, deaths scythe, angel blades, Lance of Michael, and the Colt. Cain trained the first fallen and the first born demons, forming an elite army known as the Knights of Hell. The Knights of Hell are resistant to the ancient demon-killing knife of the Kurds and holy water, and can only be killed by the First Blade. The Knights were mostly wiped out by Cain in 1863 with the last two Knights, Abaddon and Cain, eventually being killed by Dean Winchester.\n",
